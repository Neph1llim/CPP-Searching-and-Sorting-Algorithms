# CPP-Searching-and-Sorting-Algorithms
This is a C++ programming project I am currently working on regarding Search and Sorting Algorithms, Mostly self-taught and does not use AI. I find illustrations and demos and then figure out the code myself.

---

I'm done creating some Sorting Algorithms, which include:
  1. Bubble Sort
  2. Selection Sort
  3. Insertion Sort
  4. Merge Sort

---

I'm done creating some Searching Algorithms, which include:
  1. Linear Search
  2. Binary Search
  3. Interpolation Search
  4. Jump Search
  5. Exponential Search
  6. Fibonacci Search

---

I haven't fully grasped the consepts used in Merge Sort but it still taught me a lot of things.
I'm thinking of which to use Recursion or loops.

---

I'm trying to learn:
  1. Recursion
  2. Sub-arrays

---

I'm planning on creating a website about this that illustrates the proccess much better.
