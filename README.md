# CPP-Searching-and-Sorting-Algorithms
This is a programming project I am currently working on regarding Search and Sorting Algorithms, Mostly self-taught and does not use AI.

---

I'm done creating some Sorting Algorithms, which include:
  1. Bubble Sort
  2. Selection Sort
  3. Insertion Sort
  4. Merge Sort

I' done creating some Searching Algorithms, which include:
  1. Linear Search
  2.

I haven't fully grasped the consepts used in Merge Sort but it still taught me a lot of things.

I'm trying to learn:
  1. Recursion
  2. Sub-arrays

I'm currently working on the Binary Search Algorithm
